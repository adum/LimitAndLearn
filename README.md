# LimitAndLearn
Project goal: limit screen time, help a kid learn something useful while being limited.

Traditional screen time apps have very limited control over how screen time works. This project seeks to increase that control.

Beyond simply limiting, we offer learning opportunities built-in to mechanize valuable instruction.
